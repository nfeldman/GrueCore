# Grue Core

A collection of utilites from various libraries I've named "Grue". Much of this is fairly standard, but `core/mix`, `core/Eventing/EventEmitter`, and `core/Observe` might make interesting reading.

## WIP

Mostly untested in this form. Use at your own risk.

### Background

I've written 3 or 4 general purpose JavaScript libraries over the years. In 2012 and 2013 I wrote a framework that I called Grue, based on a library I'd named Fortinbras which was itself a rewrite of another library named Grue. This consists of files from those earlier projects and some newer utilities.
